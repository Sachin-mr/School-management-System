"School management System" is the project that build completely with java swings and AWT .  ![Screenshot 2024-11-24 104855](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b566b372-6361-45c1-91e7-40d0c4079c0a)

## **Abstract**
The School Management System is designed to streamline administrative tasks by providing an efficient platform.
 It includes five main modules, allowing school administrators to enroll students with relevant details, access. 
The system's menu-driven interface and error-handling capabilities ensure a user-friendly experience, enabling smooth interaction and data input. 
By automating these tasks, the School Management System reduces paperwork, improves accuracy, and enhances the efficiency and effective administrative workflow.

## **The project was developed using the following technologies:**

Programming Language: Java (Latest OpenJDK)
GUI Framework: Java AWT
IDE: Visual Studio
Database: JSON file (as the data storage system)

## **Acknowledgment**
I, [Sachin MR](https://github.com/Sachin-mr), developed this basic Java AWT project as my first endeavor into Java GUI programming for my college's Java Programming course. This project represents my initial steps in software development, and I am committed to continuously learning and enhancing my skills. I plan to improve and update this project with additional features and optimizations in the future.
